* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    
    **One of Stripe's biggest solutions is its product called Connect. It's a payment solution aimed at platform-based businesses and it helps simplify handling transactions that involve multiple parties. Connect helps solve splitting payments between multiple beneficiaries and provides instant payouts to vendors and service providers. An example is Uber Eats, where it is required to split payments to the delivery driver, the restaurant, and to Uber.**

    **Stripe's advantage is its software is capable of processing high volumes of payments without a significant increase in cost compared to its competitors. It's cost structure is simple - the fees are based on per transaction. They charge 2.9% plus 30 cents per transaction. Whereas most of their competitors charge extra fees on top. In addition, it's free to set up and there is no monthly or annual fee.**

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    **My recommendation to Stripe would be to offer it's own POS (Point of Sale) system. At the moment, they do not offer this option and you would have to purchase this hardware seperately. Whereas their competitors, such as Square, offer this option and gives them an edge.**

    [(USA Today)](https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/business/credit-card-processing/stripe-vs-square/#:~:text=While%20Stripe%20provides%20you%20with,point%2Dof%2Dsale%20system.)

---
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    
    **At the moment, Stripe's model focuses heavily on processing online transactions. I think it would be beneficial to also incorporate in-person transactions as that would help diversify their business. Not to mention, this would also be a great tool for small businesses to invest in.** 

    **Not only does a POS system offer in-person payments, but it also helps businesses to update their inventory, track sales, scan barcodes, and so much more.** 

    **Happier customers equals more business.**

---
 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    **Building a POS system would make use of programming tools such as Java, Python, and C#.**

    **In terms of hardware, you would need equipment such as a receipt printer, credit card reader, bar code scanner, and a register/connected device.**
